HyperSpy: multi-dimensional data analysis toolbox
=================================================

HyperSpy is an open source Python library which provides tools to facilitate
the interactive data analysis of multi-dimensional datasets that can be
described as multi-dimensional arrays of a given signal (e.g. a 2D array of
spectra a.k.a spectrum image).

HyperSpy aims at making it easy and natural to apply analytical procedures that
operate on an individual signal to multi-dimensional arrays, as well as
providing easy access to analytical tools that exploit the multi-dimensionality
of the dataset.

Its modular structure makes it easy to add features to analyze different kinds
of signals.

If you are interested in HyperSpy, chances are that your skills can be useful to
help fighting `SARS-CoV-2
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2>`_
aka COVID 19. Therefore, please consider contributing to the following two
projects:

* `COVID-19 Open-Source Helpdesk <https://discourse.covid-oss-help.org/>`_
* `Crowdfight COVID-19 <https://crowdfightcovid19.org/>`_

Highlights
==========


* Two families of named and scaled axes: *signal* and *navigation*.
* Visualization tools for multi-dimensional spectra and images.
* Easy access multi-dimensional curve fitting and blind source separation.
* Built on top of NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib and scikit-learn.
* Modular design for easy extensibility.

The development has been motivated by the data analysis needs of the
electron microscopy community but it is proving useful in many other fields.
