Uninstalling HyperSpy 0.6 in Windows
====================================

The HyperSpy version 0.6 Windows *full installer*, i.e. the installer that does
not require the installation of any other library, has `a bug
<https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy/issues/116>`_ that **can cause the
deletion of files unrelated to HyperSpy** in customized installations. If you
have installed HyperSpy 0.6 using the *full installers* please read further
before uninstalling HyperSpy 0.6.

The safest way to uninstall HyperSpy Bundle 0.6 is by using the Hyperspy Bundle
0.7 installer (or newer) that automatically detects and uninstall previous
installations.

If you prefer to uninstall HyperSpy Bundle 0.6 manually
you can read the rest of this document that explains how to determine if your
installation is affected by this issue and how to manually uninstall HyperSpy
0.6 if that is the case. If after reading this document you are
still unsure about what to do, please do not heasitate to contact us through
the `developers mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/hyperspy-devel>`_
before taking any action.

How do I know if my installation is affected?
---------------------------------------------

This issue should be rare but it has already affected `at least one
installation
<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/hyperspy-users/xEkQXlY345I/HZ8-0v9kfNkJ>`_.
Given the seriousness of the potential consequences it is worth to verify that
your installation is not affected by this bug before uninstalling HyperSpy.
You may be affected if:

* You have installed HyperSpy 0.6 in Windows using the *full installer*. (This
  issue affects both the 32bit and 64bit versions.) If you have installed
  HyperSpy in an already existing Python installation (e.g. EPD, Canopy,
  Anaconda...) using the `HyperSpy python installers
  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hyperspy>`_ this bug does not affect you.
* You have not installed HyperSpy in the default location and you have
  selected an already-existing, non-empty folder to install HyperSpy.

If you do not know where you have installed HyperSpy 0.6 you can find it out as
follows:

.. _find_hyperspy_folder:

Finding your HyperSpy installation folder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Find HyperSpy in the Windows "Start Menu".   

   .. figure::  images/start_menu_hyperspy.png
      :align:   center
      :width:   200

2. Right-click on the "Uninstall HyperSpy" icon to open the context menu.

   .. figure::  images/start_menu_context_menu.png
      :align:   center
      :width:   300

3. Left-click in "Open file location".

Following the above instruction the file manager should appear showing 
the HyperSpy installation folder as in the following image.

   .. figure::  images/hyperspy_installation_folder.png
      :align:   center
      :width:   500

Normally this folder contains only HyperSpy related files. However, if you have
customized the installation folder during the installation process this folder
can contain other files that you do not want to delete. In the worst scenarios
this folder can be your "My Documents" or "Program Files". If that is your case
*do not use the uninstaller* to uninstall HyperSpy and follow the following
instructions instead to uninstall it. Failing to do this will cause the
uninstaller to delete *all the files* in the installation folder, not only the
HyperSpy related ones.
