We are pleased to announce the release of HyperSpy 1.5. See the `changelog <https://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/current/user_guide/what_is_new.html#v1-5>`_ for
details.

We have also released hyperspy-gui-traitsui 1.2 and hyperspy-gui-ipywidgets
1.2. Older versions are not compatible with HyperSpy 1.5, so those packages needs to be upgraded as well.
