HyperSpy 0.8.5 is a maintenance release that: fixes 20 bugs; adds widgets to
interact with the model components in the Jupyter Notebook; contains
enhancements to the documentation and features; and introduces some important API changes.
Finally, for Windows users, the bundle release of this version enables a working install both with and without admin privileges. Upgrading is therefore highly recommended. See the `release notes
